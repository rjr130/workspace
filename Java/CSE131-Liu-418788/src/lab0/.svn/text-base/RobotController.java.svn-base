	/**
	 * YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
	 * Modify the "run" method below to guide the robot from the lab (Sever 201/202) to your instructor's office (Bryan 515).
	 * The trail that the robot leaves behind it should only go through doorways, hallways, and stairways
	 *  (no fair crashing through walls until you've tried this for 20 minutes!).
	 * Remember that programs execute sequentially, so be sure to put your instructions in the order that you want them to be
	 * carried out.
	 * 
	 * In Java, when you call a method on on object, you first refer to the target (the object that should execute the method).
	 * This is followed by a dot (.), which is then followed by the name of the method and the parameter list.
	 * Finally, each statement ends with a semicolon.
	 * 
	 * in this case, the target object will be the robot.  You will call three different methods of the robot guide it:
	 *     forward - moves the robot forward by a given number of pixels
	 *     turnLeft - turns the robot left by the given number of degrees
	 *     turnRight - turns the robot right by the given number of degrees. 
	 * 
	 * The "run" method is the only method that you need to modify for this lab assignment.
	 * The first two statements have been provided for you.  The robot will need to turn and move about a dozen times.
	 * Tip: If you point the mouse cursor on the map in the running program, and let it
	 *   sit there for a second, popup-text will show you the (x,y) coordinates to
	 *   help you plan the robot's motion.  Note that the origin (x=0, y=0) is the upper left corner and y increases down the page.
