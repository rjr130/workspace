Gardens and Natural Areas

If you're looking for a beautiful place to immerse yourself in 
nature, UW-Madison has acres of opportunity.

UW-Madison Arboretum

The UW-Madison Arboretum is just a few miles south of campus in 
the heart of the city, but its 1,260 acres take visitors to the 
wild side. Gardens, prairies, woods and more than 20 miles of 
trails will make you forget the city's bustle. Tours and classes 
are available.

Howard Temin Lakeshore Path

The Lakeshore Nature Preserve is an integral part of the campus 
landscape. It has 300 acres of woods, wetlands, open fields, 
restored prairie/savanna, and three miles of Lake Mendota 
shoreline, including two swimming beaches and many picnicking 
spots. Part of the Lakeshore Nature Preserve, the Howard Temin 
Lakeshore Path extends from the Memorial Union to Picnic Point.

Allen Centennial Gardens is a teaching garden with a great 
diversity of plantings and hardscapes. The major emphasis is on 
herbaceous ornamental perennials but the site features many 
other plantings including annuals and woody plants.

The Botanical Garden is located between Lathrop and Chamberlin 
halls. More than 500 species represent plants from all over 
the world.

The Botany Greenhouse is a refuge of greenery and serenity, 
showcasing more than 1,000 species in distinct aquatic, desert 
and tropical communities. Tours available by appointment.

The D.C. Smith Greenhouse is a tropical conservatory with 11 
growing rooms. Tours available by appointment.
